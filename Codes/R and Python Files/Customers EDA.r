  #same data except for 1 column: "Order_Item_ID" which functioned as a counter 
#This means customers could buy multiple items and appear to be "repeat customers" when they had only made 1 order
#So I made a table that eliminated all the extra rows and summed them into 1 row.

#4b. What type of areas are the zip codes in? -------------------
#I had to do this manually. I looked up a couple of the top 10 zip codes. 
  #Most of the zip codes in Rio (22790, 22793, 22775, and 22631) are from around the Barra de Tijuca, which seems to be an upscale living area. 
  #Two others from Rio (24220 and 24230) are from the Guanabara Bay, near Icarai, a beach area. 

#4c. How many are returning customers?----------
#Initially I did an analysis based on the customer ID. 
  #I counted how many times each customer ID showed up in the data (see section 2 - Initial EDA)

#However, when I looked closer at the repeat customers, 
  #I saw that there was a new row in the data table for every item purchased. 
  #When I summed up the numbers, no customer was a repeat customer.

#4d. Who are the customers that haven't purchased in the longest time?-----------
