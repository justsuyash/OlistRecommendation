<li>Review Score and sales graph shows how the growth of sales is aligning with the counts of review score. Even though we can’t conclude that review was directly affecting sales, but most customers left their reviews after they had their purchases.</ul> 
<br>
<h5>Recommendations based on reviews:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Review score of 4, in 100% scale, is only 80%.
<li>Customers are only 80% satisfied with their shopping experiences in Olist, and their ordered products. 
<li>It is recommended to have a seller improvement program (consulting) to improve customer service level. 
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<H3>Payment Type</H3>
<ul>
<li>We have 4 payment types. From 2016 to 2018 the total payment received (freight + sales) is 20.4 million.
<li>Payment Growth with payment type shows the growth of each payment type yearly. Credit card is the most used payment type. A total payment received of 15.6 million from 2016 to 2018.
<li>Payment Type and Amount shows how the categories’ payment amount are in each payment type. As the bars show from CC section, the amount paid by are way higher than the other payment types.
</ul>
<h5>Recommendations based on payment type:</h5>
Since CC’s usage grows exponentially over the years. Olist can consider launching their own credit card (co-branded cards) with incentive events or reward points…etc to increase sales.

<H3>Sellers:</H3> 
<ul>
Areas with less sellers (remote), low performing seller is mainly a geographical issue: 
<li>North: almost fully covered by Amazon rainforest, cities are spread far away from each other, lowest population density of the country
<li>Midwest: low population density, least industrialized 
</ul>
<br>
<h5>Recommendation on Sellers:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The products these sellers sold are: automobile items (largest share) and other items I believe are hard to find at the local store in a remote area: FOCUS on this kind of items! 
<li>Hypothesis: more rural areas, less access to internet than bigger cities, so e-commerce is probably not very developed there. People probably just purchase from local shops, and would only look online for items that are not available.
<li>If we find out what those are, focus on them (auto for example) and promote them, we may increase margins in these less populated areas.
Recommendation = in remote areas, focus on items not available in local stores.
</ul> 
<br>
<br>
<H3>Freight ratios:</H3>
Top 10 highest freight ratios sellers are actually located in “good areas”
<h5>Recommendation on freight ratios :</h5> 
<li>install pick up points for those sellers. Make sure pick up times are given in wide windows so sellers can pick up on their way back from work/activities
<li>Pick-up points in key areas, centralized
